# EventFilter
This is a prototype plugin, which allows registering listeners to bukkit events and filter which events will be handled by the filtered listeners.

It can be useful in listeners that should handle events related only to specific things, for example, in minigame listeners, it can be used to handle only events related to the players playing in the minigame, and not other players

[Use example](https://github.com/yzimroni/EventFilter/blob/master/src/net/yzimroni/eventfilter/plugin/test/Test.java)
